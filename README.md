# Espresso

Espresso is a learning exercise by Ryan Bacon and myself to build a small web app from scratch. The app will be like a simple version of Yelp that collects and displays user reviews of places that serve espresso.

Initially, this project will consist of a backend implemented in Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL to support an API. The frontend will be a web client using asynchronous calls to the API.

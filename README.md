# Espresso

Espresso is a learning exercise by Ryan Bacon and myself to build a small web app from scratch. The app will be like a simple version of Yelp that collects and displays user reviews of places that serve espresso.

Initially, this project will consist of a backend implemented in Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL to support an API. The frontend will be a web client using asynchronous calls to the API.

To run the app using flask on the command line,

`$ export FLASK_APP=espresso.py`  
`$ flask run`

Or you can run via

`$ python3 espresso.py`

Executing within an IDE such as PyCharm is great since it has a graphical debugger.
